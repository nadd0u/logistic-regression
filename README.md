# logistic-regression

The goal of this project is to predict whether an insurance policy customer is likely to be involved in a car accident. If it is determined that the customer is likely to be involved in a car accident, we provide a predictive estimate of the likely cost of the subsequent auto insurance claim.

Three models are developed as part of this project - a logistic regression model using all available variablesm, a logistic regressiong model using backward selection, a logistic regression model using forward selection, and a linear regression model using the same variable selection technique. The binary logistic models are intended to predict the likelihood that a person will crash their car, while the linear regression models attempt to predict the likely amount of money it will cost an auto insurance company if the person does, in fact, crash their car.
